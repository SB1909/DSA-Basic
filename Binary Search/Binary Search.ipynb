Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list. Your function should have the worst-case complexity of `O(log N)`, where N is the length of the list. You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.\n",

Thus, we may need to rotate the original list up to `N-1` times in the worst case, to come to the given list. \n",
